##Question from assignment

- ***1. What is the difference between null and undefined?***  
if the value of proeprty not exits means property has an empty reference that is null. but otherside, undefined- it's a take a reference but not set any value. like 
const data; . here the value of data is not set so it's a undefiend value. null mean not exits.  



- ***2.  What is the use of the map() function in JavaScript? How is it different from forEach()?***  
in js map() func can iterate into an array and return some value after the operation also forEach() can iterate and doing operation but don't return any value.  


- ***3. What is the difference between == and ===?***  
double equal check only values and coertion means change type of values but in other side, triple equal is very strict. check values also with their types. if value and type matched it's return true. otherwise false.  


- ***4. What is the significance of async/await in fetching API data?***  
async/await means, think like an example. if we eat first then washing our hand it's like non serial. but here async/await order to you that first you need to wash your hand then eat. this example same like in code exucution. if program take any promise the next line of code will be not excute. after resolve this promise then work next code lines. mainly it's for maintain the excution of lone of codes.  

- ***5.  Explain the concept of Scope in JavaScript (Global, Function, Block).***  
global scope- when we declare property with value in global scope, anyone or any func/method can access of this value from any where.. in function scope property are limited into an area. it's opposite of global scope area. functional scope and block scope it's like same.
